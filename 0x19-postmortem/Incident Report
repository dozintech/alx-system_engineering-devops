#Incident Report

day of incident: 20th August 2022
Timeframe of durarion: 9:00am -3:00pm (West African Time Zone)
when issue was detected: The incident took place in the morning time after routince clean up

The breakdown of the generator was for 5 hours
it completely halted any furhter producton because it was the primary power source.
what lead to this mishap was that the oil in the gen was dried up.

the incident was noticed at about 9:00am in the morning, an unsual vibration then sudden blackout in the whole operation unit.
As a result, me and one other staff went to the plant to check for any irregularities. We thought it might be that water had dried up
or it spilled and also assumed that it may be the fuel from the rubbercan feeding the plant wasnt connected properly.
we made few more check too, even on electrical connections just to ensure it wasnt as a cause of overloading the plant. 
After several investigation, we checcked for oil and discovered that there was apparently no more oil in the generator. 
A mechanic was consulted, he proposed we get 4 gallons of engine oil and refill, then also he carried out some quick service maintenance 
which  involved cleaning machine parts and cross checkinh the bolts and wires were in good state.
He came up with the suggestion that oilmust be refilled after every 4 months, but should be checked consistently before the plant is put into use.
this he said would preventive and mitgate another outbreak or breakdown of the business we were doing.
